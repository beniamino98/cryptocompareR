# cryptocompareR: A Wrapper for Cryptocompare Api in R

The package will be part of a set of developing packages that allow a "tidy" approach, for downloading, grouping and analyzing data deriving from blockchain technology. The goal of cryptocompareR is to integrate with the frameworks already introduced by other packages: first of all "tidyverse" and then "quantmod", "tidyquant", etc. and expand the range of downloadable and analysable data.

The Data were provided from the [cryptocompare Api](https://www.cryptocompare.com).
