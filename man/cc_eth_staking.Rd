\description{
Ethereum staking interest rate, from when the Beacon chain was active.
}
\details{
The Ether staking rate is powered by Attestant, a company dedicated to the business of staking.
They provide a non-custodial Ethereum 2 managed staking service, giving customers the ability to stake
their Ether using Attestantâ€™s infrastructure while always retaining full control of their assets.
You can only use this endpoint with a valid api_key.
The Ether rate is generally updated daily at 11:00 am UTC for the previous day.
